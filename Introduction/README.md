# Introduction

In the introduction of Nightmare, the objective was to familiarize myself with assembly language (it's registers and instructions) as well as get somewhat comfortable navigating and utilizing the most popular tools for reversing and binary exploitation:

* Python scripting with Pwntools
* Using GDB to view and analyze assembly code and registers of binaries
* Using Ghidra to decompile a binary into C

The end goal of the Introduction was to to accomplish a few CTF style challenges using previously mentioned tools.
